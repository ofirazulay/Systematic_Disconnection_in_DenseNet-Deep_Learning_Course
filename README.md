# Systematic Disconnection in Densely Connected Convolutional Networks - DenseNet

### Deep_Learning_Course

##### Awards: 
This Project achieved second place in the final project competition of the deep learning course at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev as part of our master's degree studies in data science. The selection of the winning projects was made by a panel of three BGU faculty members with extensive deep-learning expertise.

##### Description: 
Our research explores the effects of disconnecting connections in renowned DenseNet convolutional networks to reduce computational complexity while maintaining network performance. 
Our innovation introduced the "P" hyperparameter, defining the number of preceding layers that contribute their output feature maps as inputs to a given layer. 

We found that as "P" value increase, the number of learned parameters and complexity rise, while the accuracy improvements become less significant. 
Hence, connecting a subset of prior layers offers a viable alternative to full DenseNet networks achieving comparable accuracies.
